# Customer-Purchase-Analysis-Dashboard
This project analyzes customer purchase behavior using Excel, featuring a dashboard with visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts. Key insights include high-value items, payment preferences, customer satisfaction, and seasonal trends. Future work could focus on predictive modeling for customer churn.
Customer Purchase Analysis Project

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior using historical transaction data. The aim is to identify trends and generate actionable insights that can support data-driven decision-making for business stakeholders.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following fields:

- Review Rating: Customer rating for the purchased item.

- Payment Method: Means of payment used (e.g., Cash, Credit Card).

Methodology

1. Data Cleaning:

- Handled missing data and standardized date formats.

- Verified data types and corrected inconsistencies.

1. Analysis:

- Predictive modeling to assess customer churn.

- Identification of purchase trends and customer preferences.

- Analysis of payment method usage and customer satisfaction based on review ratings.

1. Dashboard Creation:

- Tools Used: Microsoft Excel.
